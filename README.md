# D-Trust Messaging
D-Trust Messaging allows you to chat in the most reliable way. It does so by using a decentralized point-to-point security mechanism on which the users are in charge of manually exchanging their own point-to-point passwords instead of depending on a centralized key exchange protocol.

The mechanism used by D-Trust solves the well known man-in-the-middle threat that nowadays leading messaging platforms have. As opposed to Whatsapp or Telegram, you can use D-Trust without even trusting on the server since it does not collaborate in the key-exchange process. In fact, users are responsible for manually creating the point-to-point keys that they will be sharing with their contacts. Henceforth, this is the most secure messaging service that can be provided to the community, aimed for entrepreneurs who need to exchange confidential information about their ideas but available for anyone to use under the common EU data privacy policy (GDPR, 20-Jul-18).

###### Links for desktop version have been removed until the latest server version is fully tested. The reason for this is that proper troubleshooting will be much easier if no connections are received in the domain, therefore removing clutter from the log files. Links will be re-uploaded on August 7th once the changes are fully documentated.
